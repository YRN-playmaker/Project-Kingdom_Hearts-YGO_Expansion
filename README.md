* **Fusion Monsters:** Based on ultimate weapons and Final Forms. They feature **unchainable summons** and mass-banish removal effects. They are the deck's strongest board breakers and finishers.
* **Synchro Monsters:** Based on Sora's KH2 outfit. Features a "Book of Eclipse" style effect and acts as a bridge for Link/Special Summoning.
