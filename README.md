## 🚩 Project Overview
This is a custom Yu-Gi-Oh! expansion set based on the **Kingdom Hearts** universe. It includes **70+ designed cards**, with over **30+ cards fully scripted** and playable.

To play, simply copy the expansion files into your EDOPro/YGOPro `expansions` folder.
* **Note for YGOPro 2 Players:** You may need to manually copy the images from the `pics` folder to your game's `picture` directory.

## ⚔️ Deck Introduction
The archetype is based on the lore and characters of **Kingdom Hearts**. It specializes in utilizing the **Extra Deck** (Link, Xyz, Fusion, Synchro).

**Playstyle:**
The deck revolves around the **"Keyblade Wielder"** archetype. It focuses on multi-searching, graveyard recovery, and special summoning. The deck is designed to start combos with 1-3 cards in hand.

### Extra Deck Features
* **Link Monsters:** Based on Sora's KH2 Drive Forms and Summon System. They function as **starters, disruptors, and burn damage dealers**, serving as pivots for combo extensions and fallback plays (compromise boards).
* **Xyz Monsters:** Based on various character forms and outfits. They focus on **field protection (resistance) and disruption**.
* **Fusion Monsters:** Based on Ultimate Weapons and Final Forms. They act as the deck's strongest **Board Breakers** and **Finishers** for going second.
* **Synchro Monsters:** Based on Sora's KH2 outfit and the *KH3 Second Form-E*. Used to **search for Fusion Spells** and provide disruption. The summoning method is inspired by the lore of *Roxas (Nobody) returning to Sora*.
* **Pendulum Monsters:** Represent various partners met in the story, the *7 Princesses of Heart*, and original *Organization XIII* members. They provide diverse support effects.
